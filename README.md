# Zard

Zard is a simple web tool that lets you upload `.csv` files containing contact details and download them as `.vcf` (_vCard 2.0_) files.

## Features

- Upload CSV files with contact info _(first_name, last_name, email, phone)_
- Download a .vcf file instantly; ready to import into phones, email clients

## Repo Structure

The setup is lean and to the point:

- `/index.html` - HTML markup file
- `/style.css` - CSS stylesheet
- `/script.js` - JS logic for parsing `.csv` and generating `.vcf` files
